      The HTTP route populator will emit NATS route registration messages one
      by one, with this value as the interval between each message. When set to
      zero, it will send values as fast as possible, but NATS subscribers may
      lose messages.
      Be sure to set this to a valid Golang time string.
    example: 50us
